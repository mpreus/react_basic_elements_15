Just a clock made with react.
Nested components for clock elements, separated for header and footer.
There is a ternary operator in use for improving display of minutes and seconds in the clock, as well as for months in the date.

The settings used for this project are suitable for development only and very convenient for learning because they use in-browser babel compiler. The project was verified using http-server.
